Upload File:
===============
- provides more functionality 
- Stored in memory up to a certain size and then on disk
- It is as Python file like object , we can do read and write operations

Better for large files (reads in chunks, doesnâ€™t overload memory).
Access to metadata (filename, content_type).
Supports async reading with .read() or .iter_chunks().
